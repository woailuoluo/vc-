INTRODUCTION                                    *cmake*

When working on a CMake project, this plugin provides a single command that
changes the makeprg make command's working directory to the closest 'build'
directory (see g:cmake_build_dir) upwards

COMMANDS                                        *cmake-commands*

:CMake [args]           Runs the cmake command as 'cmake ..', starting in
                        first directory called 'build', found in an upwards
                        search. All arguments are directly passed on to CMake.
                        Also modifies the :make command to build in
                        that directory.

:CMakeClean             deletes all files in the build directory. You can
                        think of this as a CMake version of make clean.

:CMakeFindBuildDir      resets the build directory path set for the current buffer
                        and then tries to find a new one. Useful if it previously
                        found a wrong path to then reset it after a new build folder
                        has been created for example.

VARIABLES                                        *cmake-variables*

g:cmake_install_prefix           same as -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

g:cmake_build_type               same as -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

g:cmake_cxx_compiler             same as -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER, however, this will have
                                 no effect until you run :CMakeClean and :CMake.

g:cmake_c_compiler               same as -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER, however, this will have
                                 no effect until you run :CMakeClean and :CMake.

g:cmake_build_shared_libs        same as -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS

g:cmake_build_dir                set the cmake 'build' directory, default: 'build'

g:cmake_project_generator        set project generator, however, this will have
                                 no effect until you run :CMakeClean and :CMake.

g:cmake_usr_args                 custom user arguments. Ex: 'let g:cmake_usr_args="-DDEBUG=YES"'

b:build_dir                      the path to the cmake build directory for the current buffer.
                                 This variable is set with the first :CMake or :CMakeFindBuildDir call.
                                 Once found, it will not be searched for again unless you call
                                 :CMakeFindBuildDir. If automatic finding is not sufficient you can set
                                 this variable manually to the build dir of your choice.

OPTIONS                                        *cmake-options*

g:cmake_export_compile_commands  same as -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON, useful for
                                 exporting a compilation database to be used with YCM
                                 (https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#c-family-semantic-completion)
                                 CMake only supports this flag with Ninja and Makefile generators.

g:cmake_ycm_symlinks             create a symlink to the compile_commands.json file in the
                                 root of the project (build/..) if the file is found.
