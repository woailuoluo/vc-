Configuration
-------------

vim-lua supports a few options. All are boolean and off by default: set an
option to 1 with `let g:lua_syntax_someoption = 1` to enable it (setting to `0`
for disabling is currently not supported -- just don't set the option at all to
keep it disabled).

- `g:lua_syntax_nosymboloperator` disables highlighting of the Lua symbol
  operators (that is, all operators except for the keyword operators and and
  or).
- `g:lua_syntax_nofold` disables code folding. If this option is set, you can
  selectively reenable some folds with `g:lua_syntax_fold_<group>` where
  `<group>` can be table, comment, function, control or string. You can also
  have even more fine-grained control by enabling specific syntax regions
  instead of groups. Look in the source code for the second argument of `call
  s:FoldableRegion` for all options, but note that the names are subject to
  change in later versions.
- `g:lua_syntax_nostdlib` disables highlighing of all standard library names
  like, `io`, `print` and even `require`, `error` etc. If that is too much you
  can use `g:lua_syntax_noextendedstdlib` instead to keep `_G`, `module`,
  `require`, `assert`, `error`, `pcall` and `xpcall` highlighted.
