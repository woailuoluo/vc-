# antlr{3,4}.vim

Syntax files for [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/).

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), and then simply copy and
paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/blinks/vim-antlr.git
